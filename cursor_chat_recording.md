# Cursor Chat Recording

## 2026-01-26

User request:
- Fix GitHub Pages rendering for skills so SKILL.md files become pages without manual index.md copying.
- Create missing skills referenced on the homepage.
- Fix LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md links.

Assistant actions:
- Added a custom skill page layout and markdown styling.
- Removed LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md from the Jekyll exclude list.
- Scoped the skills layout to the `skills` path for consistent rendering.
- Created missing skill definitions: stata-regression, python-panel-data, latex-tables, econ-visualization.
- Added a GitHub Actions pre-build step to copy SKILL.md to index.md.
- Normalized markdown spacing to satisfy lint rules.
- Added debug instrumentation to skill page layout to trace rendering and stylesheet loading.
- Added inline debug instrumentation to the r-econometrics skill content for production logging.
- Added a homepage debug probe to validate client logging pipeline.
- Updated the deploy workflow to inject `layout: skill` into generated index pages.
- Fixed `baseurl` in Jekyll config so skill layout CSS resolves correctly.

## 2026-01-26 (Later)

User request:
- Explain line by line what `_config.yml` is saying.
- Fix navigation bar home link pointing to wrong URL (https://meleantonio.github.io instead of https://meleantonio.github.io/awesome-econ-ai-stuff).

Assistant actions:
- Provided comprehensive line-by-line explanation of the Jekyll configuration file.
- Fixed the navigation home link issue by:
  - Adding Jekyll front matter (`---\n---`) to `index.html` to enable Liquid templating
  - Changed `href="/"` to `href="{{ site.baseurl }}/"` on the home logo link (line 24)
  - Updated CSS link to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/style.css`
  - Updated all submit.html links to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/submit.html` (lines 31, 387, 486)
  - Updated JS link to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/main.js`
  - Now the home link correctly points to `https://meleantonio.github.io/awesome-econ-ai-stuff/` instead of the root domain

## 2026-01-26 (Skills Catalog Refactoring)

User request:
- Remove the non-functional workflow section from index.html (clicking workflow-card items did nothing)
- Keep the Skills Catalog section but rename it to "Your Research, Supercharged!" with the same gradient styling as the old workflow section title
- Automatically generate skill cards based on SKILL.md files, categorizing them intelligently based on `workflow_stage` frontmatter

Assistant actions:
- Removed the workflow section (lines 95-139) from index.html
- Updated Skills Catalog section title to use "Your Research, Supercharged" with gradient-text styling
- Changed navigation link from "Workflow" to "Quick Start" since workflow section was removed
- Updated hero stats to say "Categories" instead of "Workflow Stages" and made skills count dynamic
- Replaced all hardcoded skill cards with Jekyll Liquid templating that:
  - Iterates through `site.skills` collection
  - Reads `workflow_stage` from each skill's YAML frontmatter to determine category
  - Maps categories to appropriate icons (💡 Ideation, 📚 Literature, 📐 Theory, 📊 Data, 🔬 Analysis, 📝 Writing, 🎯 Communication)
  - Dynamically generates skill cards with name, description, tags (limited to 3), and compatibility icons
- Renamed `skills/` directory to `_skills/` for proper Jekyll collection recognition
- Created missing index.md files for skills that only had SKILL.md:
  - `_skills/analysis/stata-regression/index.md`
  - `_skills/analysis/python-panel-data/index.md`
  - `_skills/communication/econ-visualization/index.md`
  - `_skills/writing/latex-tables/index.md`
- Updated `_config.yml` defaults to scope to collection type instead of path
## 2026-01-26 (Evening)

User request:
- On the landing page, add a button that allows to download all the skills at once, in a zip file, with the directory structure as is in the repo.
- Add a button to each skill page that allows to download the individual SKILL.md file.

Assistant actions:
- Created `assets/js/download.js` with functionality to:
  - Download all skills as a zip file preserving directory structure
  - Download individual SKILL.md files from skill pages
- Added JSZip library (CDN) to both `index.html` and `_layouts/skill.html` for zip file creation
- Added "Download All Skills" button to hero section on landing page (`index.html`)
- Added "Download SKILL.md" button to skill pages (`_layouts/skill.html`)
- Implemented base URL detection for proper file fetching in Jekyll environment
- Made `site.baseurl` available to JavaScript via `window.siteBaseurl` variable
- Both buttons use existing button styles (`.btn`, `.btn-secondary`) for consistent design

## 2026-01-26 (Fix Duplicate Skill Cards)

User request:
- Skills appear twice. The same skill is visible in two cards. This is probably due to the existence of an index.md file and a SKILL.md file for every skill. We added index.md because Jekyll seemed unable to use SKILL.md for creating a page in the website. Is there a way to avoid duplication of cards?

Assistant actions:
- Identified that Jekyll was processing both `index.md` and `SKILL.md` files as collection items, causing duplicate skill cards
- Added `**/SKILL.md` to the exclude list in `_config.yml` to prevent Jekyll from processing SKILL.md files as collection items
- Now only `index.md` files are processed as collection items, eliminating duplicates
- SKILL.md files remain in the repository for download purposes but are not processed by Jekyll

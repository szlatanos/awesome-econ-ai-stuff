## Why AI Skills for Economists?

Economic research involves complex, repetitive workflows—from data cleaning in Stata to writing LaTeX papers. AI skills automate these workflows while preserving methodological rigor.

**Skills help you:**
- 📊 Clean and transform data faster (Stata, R, Python)
- 📐 Write mathematical models in LaTeX
- 🔬 Run econometric analyses with proper diagnostics
- 📝 Draft papers following journal conventions
- 🎯 Create publication-quality visualizations

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your AI Tool

Skills work with multiple AI coding assistants:

| Tool | Skill Location | Setup |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/` | [Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/skills/` | [Docs](https://cursor.com/docs) |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/skills/` | [Docs](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |
| **Codex** | Project `AGENTS.md` | [Docs](https://agents.md) |

### 2. Install a Skill

```bash
# Clone a skill to your tools directory
# Example for Claude Code:
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/analysis/r-econometrics ~/.claude/skills/
```

### 3. Use the Skill

Invoke skills via slash commands or natural language:

```
/r-econometrics Run a DiD analysis on my treatment data
```
